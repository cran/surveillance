\title{
Plot the ECDF of a uniform sample with Kolmogorov-Smirnov bounds
}

\description{
This plot function takes a univariate sample that should be tested for
a U(0,1) distribution, plots its empirical cumulative distribution
function (\code{\link{ecdf}}), and adds a confidence band by inverting
the corresponding Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (\code{\link{ks.test}}). The
uniform distribution is rejected if the ECDF is not completely inside
the confidence band.
}

\usage{
ks.plot.unif(U, conf.level = 0.95, exact = NULL,
             col.conf = "gray", col.ref = "gray",
             xlab = expression(u[(i)]), ylab = "Cumulative distribution")
}

\arguments{
  \item{U}{
    numeric vector containing the sample.
    Missing values are (silently) ignored.
}
  \item{conf.level}{
    confidence level for the K-S-test (defaults to 0.95), can also be a
    vector of multiple levels.
  }
  \item{exact}{see \code{\link{ks.test}}.}
  \item{col.conf}{
    colour of the confidence lines.
}
  \item{col.ref}{
    colour of the diagonal reference line.
}
  \item{xlab, ylab}{
    axis labels.
  }
}

\value{
\code{NULL} (invisibly).
}
