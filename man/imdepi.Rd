\title{
  Occurrence of Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Germany
}

\description{
  \code{imdepi} contains data on the spatio-temporal location of 636
  cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by the two most
  common meningococcal finetypes in Germany, \samp{B:P1.7-2,4:F1-5} (of
  serogroup B) and \samp{C:P1.5,2:F3-3} (of serogroup C).
}

\usage{
data("imdepi")
}

\format{
  \code{imdepi} is an object of class
  \code{"\link{epidataCS}"} (a list with components \code{events},
  \code{stgrid}, \code{W} and \code{qmatrix}).
}

\details{
  The \code{imdepi} data is a simplified version of what has been
  analyzed by Meyer et al. (2012). Simplification is with respect to the
  temporal resolution of the \code{stgrid} (see below) to be used in
  \code{\link{twinstim}}'s endemic model component.
  In what follows, we describe the elements \code{events},
  \code{stgrid}, \code{W}, and \code{qmatrix} of \code{imdepi} in
  greater detail.

  \code{imdepi$events} is a \code{"\linkS4class{SpatialPointsDataFrame}"}
  object (ETRS89 projection, i.e. EPSG code 3035, with unit \sQuote{km})
  containing 636 events, each with the following entries:
  \describe{
    \item{time:}{Time of the case occurrence measured in number of days
      since origin. Note that a U(0,1)-distributed random number has
      been subtracted from each of the original event times (days) to
      break ties (using
      \code{\link{untie}(imdepi_tied, amount=list(t=1))}).}
    \item{tile:}{Tile ID in the spatio-temporal grid (\code{stgrid}) of
      endemic covariates, where the event is contained in.
      This corresponds to one of the 413 districts of Germany.
    }
    \item{type:}{Event type, a factor with levels \code{"B"} and \code{"C"}.}
    \item{eps.t:}{Maximum temporal interaction range for the event.
      Here set to 30 days.}
    \item{eps.s:}{Maximum spatial interaction range for the event.
      Here set to 200 km.}
    \item{sex:}{Sex of the case, i.e. a factor with levels \code{"female"}
      and \code{"male"}. Note: for some cases this
      information is not available (\code{NA}).} 
    \item{agegrp:}{Factor giving the age group of the case,
      i.e. 0-2, 3-18 or >=19. Note: for one case this
      information is not available (\code{NA}).}
    \item{BLOCK, start:}{Block ID and start time (in days since origin) of
      the cell in the spatio-temporal endemic covariate grid, which the
      event belongs to.} 
    \item{popdensity:}{Population density (per square km) at the
      location of the event (corresponds to population density of the
      district where the event is located).}
  }
  There are further auxiliary columns attached to the events' data
  the names of which begin with a . (dot): These are created during
  conversion to the \code{"epidataCS"} class and are necessary for
  fitting the data with \code{twinstim}, see the description of the
  \code{"\link{epidataCS}"}-class.
  With \code{coordinates(imdepi$events)} one obtains the (x,y) locations
  of the events.

  The district identifier in \code{tile} is indexed according to
  the German official municipality key (
  \dQuote{Amtlicher Gemeindeschl\enc{ü}{ue}ssel}). See
  \url{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtlicher_Gemeindeschl\%C3\%BCssel}
  for details.
  
  The data component \code{stgrid} contains the spatio-temporal grid of 
  endemic covariate information. In addition to the usual bookkeeping
  variables this includes:
  \describe{
    \item{area:}{Area of the district \code{tile} in square kilometers.}
    \item{popdensity:}{Population density (inhabitants per square
      kilometer) computed from DESTATIS (Federal Statistical Office)
      information (Date: 31.12.2008) on communities level (LAU2)
      aggregated to district level (NUTS3).} 
  }
  We have actually not included any time-dependent covariates here, we
  just established this grid with a (reduced -> fast) temporal
  resolution of \emph{monthly} intervals so that we can model endemic
  time trends and seasonality (in this discretized time).
  
  The entry \code{W} contains the observation window as a
  \code{"\linkS4class{SpatialPolygons}"} object, in this case the
  boundaries of Germany. It was obtained as
  \code{stateD <- rgeos::gUnaryUnion(districtsD)},
  where \code{districtsD} represents Germany's districts as at
  2009-01-01, simplified by the \dQuote{modified Visvalingam} algorithm
  (level 6.6\%) available at \url{https://MapShaper.org} (v. 0.1.17).
  The objects \code{districtsD} and \code{stateD} are contained in
  \code{system.file("shapes", "districtsD.RData", package="surveillance")}.
  
  The entry \code{qmatrix} is a \eqn{2\times 2}{2 x 2} identity matrix
  indicating that no transmission between the two finetypes can occur.
